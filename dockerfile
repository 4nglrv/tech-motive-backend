# In order to run `yarn run build` we need access to the Nest CLI which is a dev dependency. In the previous development stage we ran `yarn ci` which installed all dependencies, so we can copy over the node_modules directory from the development image

# Running `yarn ci` removes the existing node_modules directory and passing in --only=production ensures that only the production dependencies are installed. This ensures that the node_modules directory is as optimized as possible
